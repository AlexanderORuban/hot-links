# Contributing

We excitedly accept contributions! A few ground rules:

1. All links must be G rated: nothing explicit.
1. Please avoid controversial links. Your link may be worthwhile and representing an important cause, but if it is likely to offend or upset, this is not the right place for it. A rejection of a link on this grounds is not saying that we do not agree with its message, it is only saying that there are other venues better suited for it.
1. All contributors must abide by our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Please recognize that we a re a small team and this repository may not always be actively maintained.

## Adding a new link
When adding a new link:
- Please make sure your link is placed alphabetically in the page.
- Please have a level 2 header with a short link name (capitalized). This should be a hyperlink to the live page.
- Please have an archive link directly beneath it that uses the [Wayback Machine](https://help.archive.org/help/using-the-wayback-machine/). If the page does not render properly in the Wayback Machine or is excluded from the archive unfortunately the link is not suitable for our repository.
- Please have a short one-sentence description of the link beneath the archive link.

## Making a pull request
